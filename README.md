### 2. State Diagram

- Illustrates the lifecycle of objects or system components.
- Shows different states and transitions triggered by events.

### 3. Sequence Diagram

- Demonstrates interactions between objects over time.
- Visualizes the flow of messages and order of operations.

### 4. Class Diagram
